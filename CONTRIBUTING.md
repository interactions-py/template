# Contributing

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

### **We expect you to follow our parent organization standards, which can be found [here](https://github.com/interactions-py/library/blob/stable/CONTRIBUTING.rst)**

## Pull Request Process

Following our parent organization guidelines, our issue requirements are relaxed, whereas an 
issue is not required if you deem the feature or bugfix you wish to implement is small enough that
creating an issue would be considered excessive. Although, issues are very much encouraged to
exercise organization in the development ecosystem.

**- When contributing, please work in the relevant version branch, and target such branch on pull request creation.**
